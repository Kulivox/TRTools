Python Library
==============

The TRHarmonizer python library underlies all of the TRTools command line tools 
and can be used independently of them. See :doc:`here <LIBRARY_OVERVIEW>` for a description
of what that library does and :doc:`here <CODE_EXAMPLES>` for examples on how to use
it in your own code.

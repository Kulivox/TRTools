Plotting allele length distributions by population group
========================================================

Tools used: mergeSTR, statSTR

This vignette shows how to use :code:`mergeSTR` to merge two VCF files and :code:`statSTR` to plot allele frequencies across different sample groups for an example TR locus. It uses the example VCF files :code:`ceu_ex.vcf.gz` and :code:`yri_ex.vcf.gz` available at https://github.com/gymreklab/STRTools/tree/master/example-files. These VCFs were generated by GangSTR on samples sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. They have already been sorted and indexed.

After downloading the VCF files, we can use :code:`mergeSTR` to merge them into a single VCF:

.. code-block::

	mergeSTR --vcfs ceu_ex.vcf.gz,yri_ex.vcf.gz --out merged

This will create the output `merged.vcf`. We should index the file.

All are format (per sample) fields, not Info (per variant)

HipSTR - Q (unphased) and PQ (phased)
GangSTR - posterior probability (Q), RC (number of reads in each class), ENCLREADS, FLNKREADS - how many reads support each number of repeat copies
ExpansionHunter - no individualized score. Notions like locus coverage (LC), percentage of reads (per type) consistent with this call (adfl, adir, adsp)
PopSTR: number of reads for each allele (not per type) Format:AD
 - PHRED-scaled genotype likelihoods Format:PL
 - binning due to rounding: 100%-89%-71-56-45-35-28-22-18-14-11-...
AdVNTR - DP = read depth, SR = spanning read count, FR = flanking read count
 - Use ML - maximum likelihood - means genotype quality

Could also look at number of alleles not genotyped (does any caller opt out aside from HipSTR (info NSKIP, NFILT)?)
